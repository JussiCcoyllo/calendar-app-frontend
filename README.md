# MyLife

This project is based on a calendar. 
This application helps you to plan and realize all possible requests you encounter in everyday life. Our target audience is divided into 2 groups:
1) business version, where our functions are used for booking business trips  and planning and announcing your colleagues.
2) user version for general use, where the calendar and booking service is implemented. 
We really help you find work-life balance.
We are convinced that our app will be as useful for the standard user as for the CEO of a large company.

## Getting Started
